# Header Image Placeholder

This directory should contain the `silverymoon_header.png` image file.

Copy the header image from the staff-guide or create a new one for the user guide.

The image is referenced in:
- `assets/css/custom.css` (background image for the header)
- `index.md` (displayed on the home page)
