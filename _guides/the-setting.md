# Silverymoon: 1490 DR

The Silveraen enter this new decade with renewed hope and prospects for the future! With victory in the War of the Silver Marches and the return of their beloved Lady Hope, once presumed dead, things have been looking up, and the path to peace and prosperity lies open as Luruar rebuilds.

But not all is well in Silverymoon! Years of conflict and unrest left a toll that is not so easily dispelled. Remnants of the Orcish hordes still roam the countryside, led from the shadows by their foul Drow taskmasters since the dispelling of the Darkening; Unsightly and aberrant creatures are rumored to haunt the deep passageways below, giving birth to fright stories; Criminal organizations are emboldened by the moment, increasingly becoming a concerning threat; And even reports of undead sightings in nearby Moonlands help to paint a grim scenario.

The ranks of the Knights in Silver lie in shambles, diminished by the war in both numbers and morale, and the Argent Legion is spread thin between trying to retake Nesmé from Evermoor monsters and clearing the Silver Marches from Many-Arrow's last holdouts in a protracted campaign, difficult for both sides.

Even through all that, Silverymoon stands tall as a bastion of security, progress, and hope in the Silver Marches - and for it to keep that way, the call for adventurers is nigh! Capable and willing individuals are in high demand at the Gem of the North, their manpower sorely needed to claim back the Silveraen's much anticipated peace. Always a city to attract large numbers of magically-inclined and artistically-minded travelers, Silverymoon now sees an influx of men-at-arms and warrior types as well, and, unfortunately, refugees from states that weren't as successful against the enemy assaults. Of course, never-do-wells and scoundrels also make use of the large traffic to come and go without drawing attention to themselves…

Are you a new arrival to the city, sensing the opportunity to do great deeds and build your fortune? A resident caught in the tumult, and now dealing with the aftermath of the sieges and battles? An alumni of the arcane, set back years in your studies by the Conclave's suspended activities as the Spellguard needed reinforcement? Or perhaps your agenda is different, but similarly entrenched with the fate of the city?

Whatever your destiny, whatever your goals, **Silverymoon beckons!**

# TIMELINE

(Note that in some cases these dates may deviate from official lore.)

**1358: The Time of Troubles and the Battle of Keeper's Dale**
The gods Bane and Myrkul attempt to steal from the overdeity Ao, who responds by cursing all gods (save Helm, who was chosen to protect the gates to the heavens) to walk the earth in mortal form. Among the many impacts of this, the Drow city Menzoberranzan falls to civil war between the Lolth loyalists and those rebelling against her. As the Troubles end, Yvonne Baerne, High Priestess of Lolth, leads House Baerne to victory and the rebels are crushed. In celebration, Yvonne leads the Drow (particularly House Baerne and many goblin and kobold minions) to attack Mithral Hall, a dwarven city on the surface not far from Silverymoon. Silverymoon, led by Alustriel as the High Mage, comes to aid Mithral Hall, and drives the Drow back.

**1369: The Conclave is founded**
One of Alustriel's last acts before stepping down as High Mage is to encourage Arkhen the Icy to collaborate with her in establishing a unified school of magic: The Conclave of Silverymoon. The university officially opens to the public in 1369. 

**1371: The Confederation of the Silver Marches**
Alustriel leaves her High Mage post to become the High Lady of the Silver Marches, continuing her work to unite the Silver Marches and provide strength through alliance and cooperation.
 
**1385: The Spellplague**
The deities Cyric and Shar assassinate Mystra, the Mother of All Magic, and chaos descends as a result. Silverymoon's Mythal - the Moonbridge - is broken, but does manage to protect the city from the worst of the Spellplague's effects. Alustriel is believed to have died, but in truth Alustriel is in Candlekeep fighting to protect the Weave itself. While she is presumed dead though her position among the Confederation is filled, and Alustriel returns home to Silverymoon, eventually taking up leadership again.

**Early 15th century**
Re-established as High Lady of Silverymoon, Alustriel maintains her focus on unifying the Silver Marches. To the North, Quaervarr is brought under Silverymoon's protection, and Mithral Hall remains an old ally. To the East, an alliance is formed with the Dwarven citadel of Sundabar. To the South, the wealthy merchant city of Everlund offered support in exchange for protection. To the West, the frontier city of Nesmé held the Evermoors. Enemies of the Silver Marches find life difficult, and unease spreads.
 
**1450s: The War of the Silver Marches**
The Drow Qenthel Baenre of Menzoberranzan is commanded by Lolth to wage war on Silverymoon, an act of revenge against the goddess Mielikki who Drizzt Do'Urden spurned Lolth for. The Drow find allies of their own among the orcs, and other creatures such as frost giants and white dragons that have felt the sting of the Silver Marches being protected. Orc hordes, particularly those from the Kingdom of Many Arrows besiege the Dwarven strongholds of Sundabar and Mithral Hall, while Tiago Baenre of the Drow leads two White Dragons against Nesmé and Qenthel Baenre focusses her efforts of Silverymoon itself.

It is a victory for the Silver Marches, but a painful one. Nesmé holds out for the better part of a month, but eventually falls. The Dwarves of Sundabar retreat below ground and though they hold their gates, the above ground citadel is lost. The strength of the Silver Marches has been dealt a heavy blow.
 
**1450s to Present Day**
The Dwarves of Sundabar turn bitter, accusing Silverymoon of abandoning them during the war, and without the Riders of Nesmé the Evermoors become dangerous to travel through. Silverymoon's forces are spread thin protecting the Silver Marches. Some refer to the war as ongoing, and though the Drow have retreated it is certainly true that the Orcs of the Kingdoms of Many Arrows seem reluctant to accept defeat. Mithral Hall remains an ally, but a distant one, focussed on their own problems and sympathetic to their Dwarven kin in Sundabar. Quaervarr and Everlund rely on Silverymoon now more than ever before.

Alustriel has several forces under her command to protect the Silver Marches. The first are the Knights in Silver, often set to patrolling the wilderness and acting as the primary defence against the Orcs. The second are the Spellguard, a group of battlemages that began as Alustriel's personal bodyguard and have expanded in their duties since then. Often a member of the Spellguard will be sent to assist the Knights, providing magical support to the army.

The third are the adventurers. A motley crew of mixed abilities and backgrounds, but a vital resource, able to move quickly in small groups and respond to threats as they arise.

This is where you come in.
