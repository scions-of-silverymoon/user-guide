# Silverymoon: 1490 DR

The Silveraen enter this new decade with renewed hope and prospects for the future! With victory in the War of the Silver Marches and the return of their beloved Lady Hope, once presumed dead, things have been looking up, and the path to peace and prosperity lies open as Luruar rebuilds.

But not all is well in Silverymoon! Years of conflict and unrest left a toll that is not so easily dispelled. Remnants of the Orcish hordes still roam the countryside, led from the shadows by their foul Drow taskmasters since the dispelling of the Darkening; Unsightly and aberrant creatures are rumored to haunt the deep passageways below, giving birth to fright stories; Criminal organizations are emboldened by the moment, increasingly becoming a concerning threat; And even reports of undead sightings in nearby Moonlands help to paint a grim scenario.

The ranks of the Knights in Silver lie in shambles, diminished by the war in both numbers and morale, and the Argent Legion is spread thin between trying to retake Nesmé from Evermoor monsters and clearing the Silver Marches from Many-Arrow's last holdouts in a protracted campaign, difficult for both sides.

Even through all that, Silverymoon stands tall as a bastion of security, progress, and hope in the Silver Marches - and for it to keep that way, the call for adventurers is nigh! Capable and willing individuals are in high demand at the Gem of the North, their manpower sorely needed to claim back the Silveraen's much anticipated peace. Always a city to attract large numbers of magically-inclined and artistically-minded travelers, Silverymoon now sees an influx of men-at-arms and warrior types as well, and, unfortunately, refugees from states that weren't as successful against the enemy assaults. Of course, never-do-wells and scoundrels also make use of the large traffic to come and go without drawing attention to themselves…

Are you a new arrival to the city, sensing the opportunity to do great deeds and build your fortune? A resident caught in the tumult, and now dealing with the aftermath of the sieges and battles? An alumni of the arcane, set back years in your studies by the Conclave's suspended activities as the Spellguard needed reinforcement? Or perhaps your agenda is different, but similarly entrenched with the fate of the city?

Whatever your destiny, whatever your goals, **Silverymoon beckons!**
