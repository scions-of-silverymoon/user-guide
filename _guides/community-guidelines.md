# Community Guidelines

We have a few rules with detailed explanations to outline the expectations for everyone on the server, including staff. Give these a good read through to see if you vibe with us here before committing. The following statements describe rules for members and staff of our community to adhere to when engaging and participating on-server in any capacity. We expect all individuals in Scions of Silverymoon, regardless of role, to observe and respect these rules.

Misunderstandings do happen, and communication is a priority. Please notify staff if there are any issues that arise, or for any clarifications.

✨ **We're all here for a good time!** ✨

As stated in [Who Are We](who-are-we), we're looking to grow our community with people who want to be involved and interactive. Players will not be considered for games if they do not RP.

If that doesn't sound like your ideal server, we may not be a great fit for each other, and that's okay! Otherwise, welcome, new friends! Happy to have you.

## Rule 1: Be respectful - even in conflict

Everything can be resolved without causing a scene, aggression or even passive-aggressive comments. We do not tolerate drama or rudeness against staff or players; if there are issues that arise with either, Staff are present to help mediate conflict and maintain a friendly community we invest in together.

Please let us know if you are having any issues; we will help handle such things.

## Rule 2: No griefing, no harassment

**Griefing** is the act of chronically causing consternation to other members of an online community or, more specifically, intentionally disrupting the immersion of another player in their gameplay.

**Harassment** is defined as "aggressive pressure or intimidation", and this can take many forms; forcing or coercing another player into a situation they do not want to participate in, IC and OOC, or targeting them in a consistent and specific manner intending to cause them distress, is absolutely not permitted.

If you are caught griefing or harassing a member of the community in any form, a warning will be issued. If the warning is ignored, you will be removed.

## Rule 3: No bigotry, racism or hate speech

Spreading hatred towards another person's race, culture, gender, or sexual orientation will not be tolerated. Acting or speaking with prejudice against members of marginalized communities is grounds for immediate action. Under Mod discretion of severity, this may result in an immediate kick or ban from the server.

## Rule 4: Keep content SFW

Our server is 18+, but not rated R; violence may be descriptive but not gratuitous, adult themes may be explored but not exploited, and sex can be alluded to but not explicit.

When writing / roleplaying, Safe For Work (SFW) is the standard. Violence, sexual implications or acknowledgement (fade to black), non-sexual nudity, minor / recreational drug use, and strong language are permitted. When sharing in [🎨art-shelf](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866503700818427914), it is best practice to spoiler your art + provide context if it could be considered graphic or risque - i.e. if detailed wounds, drug use, or ambiguous posing/partial nudity/content are part of the art. Darker themes, more associated with the horror genre, are still able to be explored on server, so long as triggering content is appropriately warned for consumers!

Explicit RP (descriptions of a sexual scene), sexual assault scenes in any degree of detail, gore, and gratuitous violence (including hardcore non-recreational drug use) are not permitted. Even out of character, and even when joking, these topics are taken seriously and you will be asked to remove the content containing such.

Voice chats and streams are allowed on server - please be mindful of the content, as the rules and guidelines apply to all on-server activity. M/PEGI 18-rated games are allowed to be streamed as long as they follow the other content rules. There will be no streaming open VC games (games that involve open voice chat to outside server members) as we cannot enforce server guidelines for non-members.

Discussing real-life illegal activity on the server violates Discord Community Guidelines, and we uphold that standard.

## Rule 5: Be aware, keep communication kind

We're a community that can talk and play together, and this requires mindful, respectful conversations to do so. Please keep heavy or hot-topic arguments off the server, such as details of trauma, politics, religion, intense health issues, and other very weighty "real life" topics that can be discussed elsewhere to allow space for everyone to enjoy a stress-free space.

The rules above depict the behavior expected within the server, with all of its members. Direct messages ideally should observe a similar decorum and, most importantly, consent between the parties involved. Members can opt to answer direct messages from other Players and Staff at their own discretion, and respond to it with what tone they see fit. We do not moderate private messages. However, inadequate or harmful behavior in DMs that may be prejudicial to the community's health is discouraged and, depending on their seriousness and upon complaint, any issues that arise from it will be handled by Staff as necessary.

## Rule 6: Activity and community

Being a smaller server, focus is on quality of players to build our community instead of quantity. This involves interactive folks who are able to rp, chat and/or play on a regular-ish basis.

**New Joiners:** You have 48 hours to say hello and agree to rules, and 7 days to create a character. If you need more time, let a Helper know!

**New Member RP:** New players are asked to post an RP within the month after making a character so we can see that you're interested in getting involved in the community. There is no post per day requirement, but we recommend to keep in touch with your RP partner to make sure the pace or length of post is working for both of you.

**Current Member Activity:** Anyone not active within the last month to 2 months will be pinged, and with no response, removed.

**Not a ban:** Anyone that has been removed for inactivity is free to rejoin when able to become active again!

**Note:** If you have shown vested interest in the server by hanging out in OOC and RPing off and on, you may be allowed more time; we know things get busy.

**Communication is the best!**

## Rule 7: Creative Content and AI

We are, first and foremost, a roleplay server. D&D 5E is a game system we enjoy together, but it is not all we share. We firmly believe that the heart of this server, and the heart of roleplay, lies in the collaborative efforts of our community to tell stories together. In order to maintain the integrity, authenticity, and humanity of the stories we tell, we prohibit the use of AI-generated writing (including but not limited to content produced by language models, text generators, or similar technologies) in roleplay.

There are few places on the server where the use of AI is permitted. Players are free to seek AI-generated writing prompts to inspire questions for QOTD, as well as to suggest ideas for scenes they are unsure how to start and to summarize their favorite scenes, with consent of all parties involved. We ask all art in the art shelf and elsewhere be notated as AI-generated where applicable, and we are cautious and restrictive about the AI-supported bots on server that we choose to employ.

Games, scenes, and in-betweens are not permitted to introduce or knowingly engage with AI writing, as we feel this content undermines the efforts of our members and conflicts with our values as a community. By adhering to this rule, our community can continue to foster a rich and engaging roleplay environment that celebrates the creativity and dedication of each individual participant.
