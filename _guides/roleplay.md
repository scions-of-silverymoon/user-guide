## Roleplay in Silverymoon

Roleplay can occur in solos (by yourself), with other player characters, or with NPCs played by staff, and earn XP if you run a timer while you type with others.

### How to RP with another character:

1. Begin with finding a partner or requesting an NPC in [👀looking-for-rp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/911867303283544094)
2. Coordinate scene details in [👅out-of-character](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880924497711091744) by pinging your desired potential RP partner. Open channels are indicated with black bar at the end. Roll checks for flavor in [🎲dice-rolls](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880924716360138903)
3. Build RPXP by using your timer in [⏰roleplay-xp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544629214347284)

For best results, **Communication**. Talk before, during, and after RP. Discuss your pace, scene goals and boundaries for the roleplay.

### Scene Slot Limit

Players have **2 scene slots per character** until their second character is approved. Then, you are given an additional **3rd 'flex scene' slot**. An individual character may only be in 2 scenes at once.

Shop NPCs and Solos (if posted all at once) do not use a scene slot.

### Reminders

- Wyrmworks, Shining Scroll and Corvid's Quill are **Closed, for NPC scene use only**
- No running 'official' NPCs, gods/demon lords/named lore individuals (like Lord Neverember), or roleplaying fighting dragons (aka roleplaying any fights with enemies/monsters your character could not easily kill) on your own outside quest tables
- Unnamed town NPCs can be roleplayed, for extended interaction with named NPCs please request an NPC in [👀looking-for-rp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/911867303283544094). Staff may post an open scene for NPCs there as well

## Post Format Model

An example of our standard scene format:

### 🚪 Entrance and exits

Enter Syn **Bold text**.

After an exit, use `!br` to indicate the finished scene.

### 🗣️ Speaking

"Like this"

### ✍️ Narration

Like this - *italic text*

### Hidden/other language

"Like this" [Abyssal] - ||"Spoiler text"|| [Language name]

---

### Example Scene:

**Enter Rosemary**

*A halfling woman dances into the scene, smiling at the reading audience. She waves.* "Hello! Welcome to Silverymoon. Would you like some fresh bread and jams?"

*Her familiar imp sits upon her shoulder, chiding her.* ||"Stop trying to break the fourth wall."|| [Infernal]

*The two leave the way they came with a wave and a swish of the tail.*

**Exit Rosemary**

## RPXP

RPXP accrued with the timer turns into real XP when you pay lifestyle in [⏰roleplay-xp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544629214347284) at the beginning of every week. Timers can be run for both characters at once, but one character cannot earn double xp for being in 2 scenes at once.

**Solos do not earn RPXP.**

### Timer Commands

Run in [⏰roleplay-xp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544629214347284), commands are pinned there also.

- **Start timer:** `!rp start`
- **End:** `!rp end`
- **End, asynch:** `!rp end asynch`
- **Pause:** `!rp pause`
- **Restart again:** `!rp start`
- **For fixing rp and info:** `!rp help`
- **Switch chars:** `!char name`

Amount earned is based on proficiency, and caps are visible at the bottom of timer.

### ⏲️ Synchronous timers

Used when replying within a 2 hour window to their RP partner(s), simultaneous roleplaying. Begin the timer when you start typing, and end timers when your roleplay session has ended. Pause if needed.

### ⌛ Asynchronous timers

For replies beyond 2 hours between posts. When finished with one post use `!rp end asynch` to give an adjusted amount of RPXP, capped at 2 hours.

**Do not pause when finished, or you will go beyond cap and lose that XP.**

## Asking for NPC

NPCs are available for running shopkeepers, barkeeps, townspeople NPCs, or requested general use NPCs (like a tutor for a language, or a temple cleric), and earn RPXP.

See list of available major NPCs in [👥npc-directory](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/966429991707488346).

**Personal NPCs centered around your character's story should be roleplayed by yourself, within the written guidelines.**

Ping NPC in [👅out-of-character](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880924497711091744) or post in [👀looking-for-rp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/911867303283544094), and let them know what your roleplay goal or intended purchase is. Responses can take up to 2-3 days depending on availability of staff. We thank you for your patience in advance!

**Note:** Magic items do NOT require a staff interaction to purchase. Please ping Tracker Helper in [🧾transaction-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881217696023326720) when purchasing or selling magic items for approval.

## PvP

### Sparring

Two characters can spar with each other in rp channels without using attack commands, with both player and character consent. Hostility may occur, with consent; assume that a guard would stop any player on player crime or attacks.

### PVP

Two characters can fight each other in [🎃grabiakx-arena-rp](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881351609014157342). Please see directions in [📜grabiakx-arena-guidelines](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881351804288376883). (Arena can be used for solo scenes as well.)

Arena fighting of any kind counts as one rp scene.

These encounters are mandatory and intentionally non-lethal, and player run. If you need aid for the arena, please ping DM in [👅grabiakx-arena-ooc](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881351669990969405).

### Non-Canonical Combat: Dream Arena

Check the guidelines in [🍻dream-arena-guidelines📜](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/895464075692224543) for more information. This can be your in-server character, or any other character you've made up, run a whole tournament there, go wild. Entirely player-run! Have fun!

Anything that happens in DA does not carry over to the server canon, though you might have your character remember the occurrence in a vague dream, if you wish.
