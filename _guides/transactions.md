### Once finished with any purchase or selling:

Run your `!transaction` with correct coins in [💰xp-and-gold-logs](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544082331369472), and record purchase in [🧾transaction-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881217696023326720) so we can see exactly what was bought.

## 🔻 Logging XP and Gold 🔻

All gold transactions need to be logged in [🧾transaction-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881217696023326720) with a descriptor of what was bought or sold. For magic items, also ping Tracker Helper for approval. A format is pinned in the channel for easy copy-paste.

### 🪙 Gold is written in [💰xp-and-gold-logs](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544082331369472) as:

```
!transaction <+/-#currency> [+/-#currency] <"Reasoning">
```

*Example:* `!transaction +25gp -5sp "Bought stuff"`

This command needs currency (i.e. gp), and explanation to work.

### 📖 XP earnings, need a description:

```
!xp # [Reason for gaining XP]
```

*Example:* `!xp 560 RPXP`
