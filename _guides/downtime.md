# Downtime Activities

What are DTs, and how to do them.

## What are Downtime Activities?

Downtimes are a character's 'free time' where they can earn extra gold, XP or learn a new spell, tool, instrument or language proficiency.

- Run up to **2 DT per day, 14 total per week** per character
- Resets with lifestyle on Sundays
- No RP requirement, run anytime
- No weapons or armor proficiency per RAW

For a list of activities, see [🧯downtime-info🎻](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881208249762848788), or run `!dt help` in [🤖bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866397299437600778).

### Full information on each command:

- `!dt help [downtime]` - and to see what features and proficiencies help in your rolls, use `!dt help features`

## What are Proficiencies?

Learning a proficiency lets you learn a new tool, vehicle, instrument or language skill. **Only one proficiency can be learned at a time.**

The more difficult the topic is to learn, the more progress it requires to complete.

*(i.e. A standard language will be easier than an exotic language)*

`!dt help learn` will show the available list of topics and progress needed.

### How to Learn

1. Run the command listed for chosen topic
2. When done learning, run `!dt learn last` in [🧠learning-log📝](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881630481102303262)
3. Update Beyond/Dicecloud sheets with new proficiency, and run `!update`

Proficiency can be added to vsheet by using `!manage` or `!tool`.

To see the full list of what your char has learned, run `!dt learn log`

## How to Copy Spells

Downtime using `!dt spell` automatically removes the cost and uses time for spell copying, from spell scrolls or other players. Must be rp'd if from someone else.

**1 DT = 2hrs of practice and 50gp, per RAW.**

### Who can copy spells:

Wizards, Tomelocks, and those with ritual caster feat.

### Process:

1. Buy spell scroll from [📜shining-scroll](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/880874392316420117) or copy spell from another player in RP
2. Run `!dt spell type level` for the school of magic and spell level you are learning in [🩺downtime-log🔬](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881218238170665043)
   - *Example: `!dt spell necromancy 2`*
3. When done learning, run `!dt spell "spell name"` to record it into your learning log
   - *Example: `!dt spell Wither and Bloom`*

## How to Reset DTs: Weekly lifestyle charges

Run `!week` in [🍻weekly-logs💸](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544281408897024) **once a week on Sunday** to remove the 7 gold for cost.

Lifestyle covers each character's rent/Inn charges, all meals and drinks for roleplay purposes, and converts your RPXP to real XP while resetting your downtimes.

While there are no consequences or punishments to forgetting to meet your rent or forgetting to run `!week`, we ask players to not forget to do it, as it is part of the server's mechanics and activity checks.
