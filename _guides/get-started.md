# Getting Started

Last steps in character creation to start in Silverymoon.

## Starting Commands

### 🔹 Order of Commands 🔹

In case you missed this step in creation, enter the following command with your character sheet link into the [🤖bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866397299437600778) channel to upload your character into the system:

```
!import dicecloudsheetlink.com
```

**1.** Run `!getstarted` in [🍻weekly-logs💸](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544281408897024).

*(For Transferred Characters - you have extra steps to assure your XP and gold transfers accurately.)*

**2.** Run `!xp # Transfer XP` in [💰xp-and-gold-logs](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544082331369472) to transfer XP, et voila!

This will set up your roleplay counter, and your downtimes. Please ping a Helper if there are any issues in this process.

*(If you would like to sell and purchase items at this time, you may do so in [🧾transaction-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881217696023326720))*

## Nickname and Roles

### 🔻 Change Your Nickname 🔻

Once you are approved please change your nickname. It should be in this format:

**Character Name [Level#] (Your preferred name)**

With more than one character, separate and list both:

*Example: George Washingtonian [7]|Jane Doe [4] (Sally)*

**Note:** Variations of these are permitted, as long it becomes clear which character of yours is at what level, and your preferred name can be found somewhere, in either your nickname or your profile.

### 🔹 Player Roles 🔹

Head over to [🧮player-roles](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881205108329807962) to accept the correct roles for your character, timezone, and lineage if applicable.

Add your availability for games in [🥽spectator-n-sesh](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885178705947787334).

## Avrae Command Set-up

These commands influence your downtime bonuses on the server:

`!level` - Will show you how to set your level and abilities on AVRAE. More commands are in [Quickstart Commands](quickstart-commands).

**Keep in mind that proper set-up and having your sheet working in Avrae is important, and not optional. Ask for help as needed, but do not skip those steps!**

If you have not already:

Review [Downtime](downtime), [Roleplay](roleplay), [Transactions](transactions) and [Quest](quest) before posting for games, scenes or transactions.

**Please remember to check pins in every channel!** These have instructions, info or helpful reminders and commands. ❤️

## Tool Proficiencies

If your character does not have any tool proficiencies, feel free to skip this part. Weapon and armour proficiencies are taken care of automatically, this is just for things like musical instruments, thieves' tools, vehicles and so on.

Our Downtime system replicates different professions, and does give bonuses for proficiency in relevant tools, but you will need to set up those tool proficiencies for them to be counted. You may also find they come in handy during games!

Head to [🤖bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866397299437600778), and for each tool you are proficient in, run `!tool pro <toolname>`.

For example:
- `!tool pro Lute`
- `!tool pro Thieves Tools`

If you have tool expertise, instead run `!tool exp <toolname>`

You can see a full list of available tools with `!tool all`, if in doubt, and can check your current proficiencies with `!tool list`.

### If you have any doubts or questions:

- For syntax, check `!tool help`
- For what counts as a proficiency, and whether this is something you need to do, tag a Helper
- If you think the system is not working as it should, tag a Dragonspeaker
