## Character Creation FAQs

### Level? Races? XP type?

See [Character Creation Guide](character.html) for creation guidelines.

### Only Dicecloud? Really?

No! You may use Dicecloud V1 and DDB if you want, however, we do not own campaigns in D&D Beyond to support all the races and features we play with here, so if you want to play with anything besides the basics in DDB, we cannot help you.

### Is there travel between worlds for my character to be from xyz?

There are not currently portals to other planes readily available, so while your character may have originated from elsewhere, they would not be able to travel back to that plane freely. Spells that permit this kind of travel are restricted and requested to not be used. Imagine that the Conclave does not like that!

### UA? Spelljammer?? Baldur's Gate 3??? (And other official material.)

We have an extensive list of what is allowed or not in the [Character Creation Guide](character.html)!

### Would you allow re-skinned races?

Yes! Keep in mind, a properly re-skinned race means you're choosing an official race, but having superficial differences. I.E. officially you chose a Tabaxi but they appear wolflike humanoid instead, keeping all the racial features; essentially reflavoring a current, allowed race. This does not allow for special feats, unique modifiers, unique resistances, etc. Ask a Helper if there are any questions if your idea may be allowed.

### I'm unhappy with my character, what do I do?

You have a few options:

1. **Retirement.** You can transfer your progress to another character, gold, xp and magic items! This also applies if a character would die in combat.
2. **Change your current character;** Class, subclass, feats, spells and/or stats. Ideally this change would make sense in some way for their progression, so we ask that it has an RP'd reason, and this kind of change does not happen frequently. It is important to like what you play.

We ask you not to retire or overhaul characters this way frequently so your character has some time to grow, stretch their wings and experience fulfilling IC relationships with others. Changes are subject to Mod approval. Please ping Mods if you would like to start this process.

## Mechanical FAQs

### Can I change my lifestyle payment up/down to what I chose during creation?

No; for the ease of the server program, there is one choice of lifestyle payment for 7gp weekly. Completing one downtime will easily cover that cost, so don't worry about it being higher than what you'd like - you are free to roleplay your character's lifestyle in whatever way you choose.

### Can I go without a lifestyle cost?

No - Lifestyle is required weekly to reset your downtimes, your RPXP, and as a cover-all for the Inn, food and drink your character would be using. Even if you don't use DT or RP, you must run the command weekly, on Sunday after 12am/00:00 in your timezone.

### I want to kill off my character to make a new one - Can I?

Respectfully, we ask you to not do this. If your character has relationships with other player's characters, this could impact them negatively, and frankly in our experience players decided death/murder has only caused drama. Feel free to have you char leave in some other fashion before starting a new one. Should this be a desire of retirement for a longstanding character, it can be discussed with Staff.

### Do coins and XP transfer to my beyond sheet?

`!g coins` and `!transaction` does transfer to your DDB sheet, but inventory from bags and XP changes do not automatically update. Inventory should be kept up in Beyond for your `!action` list at minimum, and XP in AVRAE for `!transactions` to be accurate.

### What kind of VTT (Virtual Tabletop) is used?

Owlbear Rodeo virtual tabletop will be used a majority of the time, as the basis for the server. DMs, however, are welcome to use other facilitating programs such as Roll20, Foundry, AVRAE Maps, etc. They will communicate this to players beforehand within the mission posting to give some time to prepare.

## Shop FAQs

### Are item prices negotiable? I have \<insert expertise, background feat, etc here\>

Prices are firm for everyone's ease and to remove bias. This is non-negotiable.

### Can we get higher quality magic items from quests?

Yes, magic items of higher quality than uncommon may be rewarded by DMs through games. The magic item rarity will increase with the difficulty and length of the game. Rarity level of 'Rare' and above, as well as Level 3 spell scrolls are only available via quests.

### Is there a list of buy-able magic items in Silverymoon?

Yes! Our item list is available in [Transactions](transactions.html).

### My desired item isn't on the list. Is it buyable?

As the list has been recently updated, it is likely not purchasable- but please ask in the questions-for-the-staff channel to be sure it wasn't overlooked.

### Can we sell magic items we get? What about to other players?

You may sell back non-consumable magic items in the shops for half price through the same process you buy them. Trading is available through the trading-post channel rules (and applies to gift exchanges).

## Spell FAQs

### Can we copy items from the library of different spells?

There are no spellbooks available in the library to copy for Silverymoon lore. The scroll would need to be purchased self-serve, or in the magic shop via NPC or obtained during a game. If purchased, log in [🧾transaction-log](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881217696023326720), in addition to the magic inks and time needed to copy down in your characters spellbook by using [🩺downtime-log🔬](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881218238170665043). Once added to your book, please record in [🧠learning-log📝](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881630481102303262) as formatted.

### Can we copy spells from other people's spellbooks?

If they are the same class of spells you can use, yes! With their permission given in a roleplay setting (otherwise, your character would not know they had it.) You will still need to log the spell in [🧠learning-log📝](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881630481102303262), and pay the price of the magic inks, taking time to practice by running the DT in [🩺downtime-log🔬](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/881218238170665043).

### What about spells from [specific setting]?

There are particular spells limited to certain wizards (e.g. the chronurgy and graviturgy wizards), and others that may be setting limited, like backgrounds. These will have some indication in their description that they would not be available everywhere. (i.e. certain AI, and Strixhaven spells)

## Roleplay/Quality of Life FAQs

### Is there crafting available on the server?

Not currently, and there may never be. Crafting is a tricky mechanic that makes it hard to keep track of who made what, how long they actually spent on it, and materials needed to make it (whether potions, poisons, or weapons).

This might mean you need to avoid the poisoner's feat, for example, if you want to actually make use of your 4th level feat option, unless you prefer rp flavor only.

### Can I have a pet?

Yes! We love little fuzzballs (or scaly things, no judgement), and they can bring another personality to rp. The stipulations of having pets or livestock on the server are as follows:

- Non-magical, reasonable, realistic to setting, mundane pets allowed for RP purposes only (no combat use)
- They give no added technical benefit to the player (i.e. no magical transitive properties to the owner, such as seeing through their eyes to 'know all')
- Any animals with a WotC set price (like Warhorse) following those guidelines, can be purchased per RAW pricing listed

### My character wants to own a shop, or live in a house. Is this allowed?

As long as it does not significantly influence or control the environment setting (see [Player Rules](player-rules.html)), we do allow players to have some flexibility. There will be no separate channels for houses or cart-shops, these may use the flexible city flex channels in each district. There may be no actual gold exchanged- these are for RP purposes only.

### How much leeway do we have in RPlaying our PC's \<pet, patron, god, talking sword, etc.\>?

This is similar to the answer above, with a few caveats. The short answer is, as long as it does not aid in the character meta-gaming (knowing more than they should in that situation, without permission or an approved/agreed roll), and does not heavily influence or control the environment setting, its considered flavor and acceptable for you to have fun with!

❗ **If you'd like regular interactions with an extraneous, powerful characters, like a patron, we suggest lesser powerful, unnamed beings.**

We ask that you do not RP a major deity or named character from FR Lore in a way that could go against realism for that figure, dictate excessively in their voice, or change history/go against established Lore. A message via pigeon, symbol/sign, a dream or even small conversation irregularly is acceptable, but Orcus appearing on the plane for Sunday tea weekly is not.

Should you want a large interaction to happen for a life changing event or important part of your character's development with such a god or demon, ping NPC and we can chat about how this may happen.

## Downtime FAQs

### Can you make \<insert proficiency focus\> DT?

Suggestions can be made in [📝suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866503752373764116), however, there are a large variety of DTs to currently choose from that should fit most skills.

### You need to add my expertise into \<xyz DT\>!

Most of our downtimes consider proficiency, and expertise, if it is applicable. If you're missing a tool bonus, you may need to use `!tool` in [🤖bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866397299437600778) to add it to your sheet.

### Does \<specific DT\> work with my class feat, or can I get advantage?

Nope. Coding for these downtimes is specific to numerical values that can be pulled from your character's information. We cannot customize DTs to your situation, outside of skills and proficiency, or roll specific numbers/advantages instead of what is programmed. A large number of bonuses and proficiencies are already considered in the current list.

### If I messed up on DT learning, can I fix it?

Yes, any progress counter can be changed. Let a Helper know in a chat area should you need help.
