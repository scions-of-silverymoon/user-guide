# Character Creation Guide

All about characters, including how to make or transfer a new one.

## Starting Character Set-Up

- All characters start at **level 4**
- **XP leveling**
- **Point Buy** for Ability Scores
- **Fixed HP**
- **400gp starting gold**, starting equipment, but no background gold
- You may buy mundane items and sell starting equipment after creation approval process
- Faerun-centered, time-wobbly Forgotten Realms setting (not extremely strict to Lore-timeline to allow some flex)
- All alignments allowed*

*Please keep in mind any characters played as hating others or entirely non-social, tend to make for a bad time roleplaying in a server community. Make something that will last, grow and build relationships. 💜

### Development details you need to build your character:

- A reason to come to and stay in Silverymoon
- Why they may talk to others in RP, taverns or everyday city rp
- Motivation for completing quests

## 🔸 Character Submission 🔸

### 1. Create your character on Dicecloud v2!

If you have the content in DDB or prefer Dicecloud V1, you may use those and skip this brief Dicecloud tutorial. However, they are not supported, so if there are issues with it, we might be unable to help you.

**To start in Dicecloud V2**, open Dicecloud and subscribe to the following libraries on Dicecloud. These can be found under the Libraries tab on your sidebar or menu:

- Libraries of Vexus
- Libraries of Vexus Homebrew
- Bloodhunter 1.4
- Critical Role Content Collection

**Note:** Libraries of Vexus contains all SRD content, so unsubscribe from the SRD library to avoid unnecessary duplicate info!

Next, go to the Characters tab and click the red circle to create a new character.

1. When prompted, make sure all four libraries you subscribed to are selected, then click create.
2. When prompted to choose a ruleset, choose **Tameran's Library of Everything Character Base**.
3. When prompted to choose sources, check all bundles **except Planeshift and Unearthed Arcana**.
4. Next, you will have the opportunity to insert House Rules: Silverymoon has none, so skip this.
5. Next, you can add Extensions: This is primarily used at IRL tables. Feel free to skip or add. Starting Feat is not permitted.

Proceed to Character Creation and follow our video tutorial and/or the built-in Dicecloud tutorial.

### 2. When your character is ready, submit it

Submit your character with the form pinned in [📬sheet-submission📩](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544907970674709).

The following command entered into [🤖bot-spam](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866397299437600778) will upload your character into the system:

```
!import dicecloudlink.com 2014
```

**Remember to add 400 gold, equip your weapons and armour, or they will not show up in Avrae!**

### 3. Once your sheet is submitted

Tag a Helper in [🤷🏿character-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866543836804677682) so they can look it over and move you forward, or offer tweaks.

## 🔹 Character Profile 🔹

### 4. Once approved, create a profile

Create a profile in [🧚character-profile🧛🏻](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866543876294180904). Follow the pinned format and give us a little insight into who will be joining our world!

It's something that gives a synopsis of your character for future roleplay partners. Art is encouraged, but optional!

### 5. Ping the Helper role for the final check

Upon approval, then you will receive the Member role, and the world will open to you fully!

### 6a. Read through the guides

If you haven't already, read through [Downtime](downtime.html), [Roleplay](roleplay.html), and [Transactions](transactions.html) to understand how things are run, and how to post on the server. [Quest](quest.html) reviews game rules and conduct.

### 6b. Once you're ready to begin

Get to [Getting Started](get-started.html) to finalize your character. This preps you for any rolls you make, and all the commands we use in Avrae.

## 🟣 Second Character 🟣

You are allowed to create a second character once your first reaches Level 6! Follow the same instructions and guidelines as above to introduce your second character.

## 🔸 Retirement or Transference 🔸

Characters, no matter how beloved (or, sometimes the opposite), must find their way out of the city and on to new lands at some point in their lives-- including the undying ones. When you decide you would rather play another character, you may close a character's story with a retirement, and start a new one.

**You must talk to your Mods about this decision.**

This is done to make sure you're certain about this decision, and to get a better picture of why, as well as to prevent haphazard retirement. Characters create important bonds with others, and a retirement can affect it negatively. Mods will make sure that the adequate communication has happened, and if there is anything they can do to help through this process.

### Retirement has been approved

Head to [🚪character-retirement](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/895650028809506846). Once that is approved, you can send your character off with an explanation or epitaph, or description of their departure, so we can all wave them goodbye. We recommend not killing them, in case you change your mind and would like to see them back, and so there's not great upset among the characters that once knew yours. Deaths are approved exclusively case-by-case.

### Inheritance matters! Don't delete your old sheet.

Before you start deleting things left and right and creating a new sheet, decide what you would like to do with your old character's items. You may throw all their gold and items into the void and start with the standard 400gp. That is the easiest way, but not the only way.

### Transfer of items and gold

The most used method of transfer is sending all your retired character's gold to the new one, as well as all magical items. You should list all those items and gold when you post your sheet in [📬sheet-submission📩](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866544907970674709). All mundane items must be transferred to your new character exactly as your previous character had them. This helps ensure fairness and consistency in sheet checks, as well as makes our Helpers' checking process a little easier!

### Some of these items don't work for me anymore!

If you have an arcane focus (that gives you a +1 to spell endeavours), an upgraded weapon (that gives you +1, similarly), or any item of the Minor Rare or higher tiers of rarity, you may ask to have them exchanged for a similar item that will be useful to you. Items that you would like to exchange but do not fall in the categories above can be sold for half their original price after the whole transfer process is done through the standard procedure of submission and approval.

## 🔺 Level 20 🔺

We have been an active community for long enough that some of our characters have and will reach the level cap that 5e has established. And we mean to honour what bonds and stories these special characters have created, their players who have put a lot of time and talent into them, while also encouraging long-time players to create new stories and breathe fresh air into Silverymoon.

Part of the joy of creation is seeing what you've made come to fruition, and an equally important part is beginning the process all over again in new and exciting ways. We will not force a player to retire a character, however that character is eligible to a series of benefits:

### Hall of Heroes!

This is a channel ([🥇hall-of-heroes](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1237136268480221244)) exclusively to celebrate those characters that have reached the highest level of the game. Similar to the character-profile channel, this is where players can post in-depth summaries of their characters' stories, as well as their favorite art pieces and "retirement" plans. This is not the same as character-retirement -- only Level 20 characters are permitted in this channel, and it does not indicate that the character will no longer be on the server.

### Third Character (for roleplaying)

Your character will be eligible to become a sort of "third character." This means that the player will be able to create a new character at level 4 with a bonus of a Rare item of your choice or equivalent gold, while holding on to their Level 20 character to RP.

The Level 20 character can only be in one scene at a time, NOT counting from your total of 3 scene slots. The total number of scene slots will not change from the current limit of 3 standard channel scenes and 1 open channel scene. The Level 20 character will not accrue RPXP for this scene, although their partners may run their timers as normal, if they are not also Level 20.

### Gaming at Level 20

The Level 20 character is eligible to participate in lower-level games as a cameo if justified by the player and agreed to by the DM. Additionally, the Level 20 character is eligible to participate in Wish quests if requested and in non-Wish games for characters of Level 17+, where they will receive gold and item rewards, but no XP.

Once or twice per year, as time and character quantity permits, Level 20 characters will be able to participate in games exclusive to Level 20s, if there are DMs willing to run those games.

## 🛡️ House Ruling: Ending Paladinphobia 🛡️

In RAW, to multiclass a character must meet the prerequisites for both their starting class and the class they wish to take on (i.e., a monk wishing to multiclass into barbarian must have both STR 13 for the barbarian prereq and DEX 13 as a monk).

While this is no problem for the majority of multiclasses, the prerequisite for a paladin is STR 13 and CHA 13. We believe this places an undue burden on our favorite divine smiters, particularly those who opt for a more dexterous build, whereas a similar class like Fighter gets to choose STR or DEX.

**Therefore, for paladins wishing to multiclass, we are ruling that your character may have either STR 13 or DEX 13 to meet this requirement.**
