# Quest Guide

Game definitions, guidelines and about character death.

## Quests

Games that earn XP are posted in [🤺play-by-post-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885162685505863701) or [🎪live-games](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/885356489961775164). Click the ✅ to sign up for selection!

Games may be Play-by-Post only, or Voice-Chat/PbP hybrid. If the game involves VC DMing, it will be advertised.

**Requirement:** One character per game at a time.

**Bounties** can be 1-2 live sessions, a few weeks of traditional PbP, or a combination of the two.

**Missions** are 2+ live sessions, or beyond 4 weeks of traditional PbP.

**Events** do not earn XP, but will offer a chance at a gold and/or item prize, in [🎉events](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/962771936528728134). You can join an event while in a bounty or mission.

### What are 'Live Sessions' vs 'Traditional PbP'?

**"Live" sessions** occur in a set amount of hours on one scheduled day where all players are present and posting simultaneously, no VC required.

**"Traditional" Play-by-Post** has no set hours. Players required to post at least once a day, with games lasting multiple weeks.

## Game Etiquette

### Prep & Check In

Prep any weapons and spells if needed in Beyond, then post your `!vsheet`, tokens and any other info requested by DM to confirm your spot.

If you do not check in by your DM's requested start time, your spot may be given to the first alternate in the party lineup.

### DM tables, DM rules

Check the pins and communicate about questions.

### Be present & posting (within required timeline)

Communicate with your DM if you cannot post within time requested.

**Live AFK** - If you need to step away for more than 15 minutes, let your DM know.

Players who do not may be passed in combat initiative or RP, and if continue to be MIA, may be removed from the game with partial or no reward.

**Traditional AFK** - Posts minimum 1x per day (with DM discretion) if not in combat/initiative, every ~12 hours in your turn at combat/initiative. If you will be away for a day or more, let your DM know. Multiple ping reminders, or no reply for 3 days, may result in removal from game.

### Games are group activities!

...Which means a game's pace depends on players being available to set events in motion and collaborate towards solutions. It should not go so fast that some players are left behind, missing the chance to give their input entirely, nor so slow that it exceeds vastly the expected runtime for a game.

Please be mindful of your pacing and each other's during a game, and remember to engage with all players at the table. It might be tempting to catch up in a game with a character who you haven't written with in a while, or to use something in the game to highlight your personal story arc, but do not prioritize such opportunities to the detriment of the table. Scenes are for that, not games.

Remember to always ask your table before your character decides upon a course of action that goes against the collective table goals. This being natural to your character is not an excuse to foiling plans or causing non-consented drama. Remember that you have created a character to play in groups, not to prioritize your personal story over everything else.

### Real Life Emergencies

Nobody would sign up to a game if they knew a big disruptive event would happen in their life. When you sign up to a game, you are making a compromise to being available, but if things truly leave control and how much is doable for a table to wait, you may request or be requested to leave a game. Speak to your DM about it, and they will see ways where you can leave the table. For those with genuine need to part ways, we can find a few ways to reward you for the time you have already invested a game.

### No synch RP during live games

Respect the DM and other players time.

## Player Selection

Selection is up to DM discretion, but not without checks and balances. While DMs reserve the right to coordinate and prepare their game as they see best to run it, and the right to employ reasonable criteria like chemistry, tone, PC skills, etc. in their decisions, there are a number of staff and roles designed to keep things open and encourage a wide scope when bringing people into their tables. These include (but are not limited to):

### Looking at all available characters across the server

DMs always check to see which levels may not have had a game in a while during the game-making process, and are encouraged to distribute those ranges among themselves. Sometimes discussions about it inspire DMs to get games and ideas they have been saving and waiting for an opportunity to use.

### Games are approved first, players are chosen later

There are many elements that are part of this selection from all the available characters in their chosen range, down to a preliminary list. Some of them are game history on server, schedule availability, PC build, existing PC relationships, RP activity, etc. Many of those can only happen at the Player Selection date, so often the final decision on Players is the last part of this process.

### Player considerations are always, without exception, brought to team discussion

It allows for DMs to coordinate if there is level and time overlap between their games, and to ensure all choices are made with good reason. This step often takes multiple days, if not a week or more, and includes insight from our Tracker Helper staff to ensure they are not overlooking important criteria.

Only after all that, does it reach player ears in [📞quest-ooc](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/1022191450240327742). Games and the characters who play them go through multiple long rounds of change and recalibration before they are made public, and no decisions about balance or party composition are made lightly. For these reasons, we emphasize that **DMs are not obligated to disclose the selection method.**

## In-Game Character Death

DMs will not intentionally try to kill you, but dice can be cruel, and some games will be advertised as deadly.

Here are your options if it happens:

### Necromancy

Another player may use revivify in combat, or your group can bring your body back to town (if possible), where the dead character will pay for raise dead, reincarnation or resurrection from a town cleric or druid healer. Can be performed by another character, materials required.

### Reborn

Work with your DM to discuss the storybuilding options including Reborn to bring them back in or after current game. Note: Likewise, this applies to characters coming back dhampirs if they die by a vampire, and other applicable situations.

### Stay dead

Start a new character! See the [Character Guide](character.html) for details.
