# Player Rules

These rules involve character and roleplay. Also important.
Any clarifications can be asked in the [💬staff-help](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866400097869545492) channel.

## Rule 1: Be environmentally conscious

🤝 **Inane actions** (such as stealing a purse, chatting with an unspecified vendor, narrating a stag walking through the meadow) may be RPed without concern if they occur for only one PC. (Any interactions between two or more PCs requires consent for things like stealing.)

🚫 **Actions that would disrupt the environment** (attempting to kill an NPC or citizen, summoning a demon in the city, destruction of public property, dictating NPCs/Citizens in depth, etc) are not allowed.

### Writing for your PC's NPC and background characters

Writing for your PC's NPC and background characters is permitted in some limited cases, such as a familiar/steed/companion or an irregularly-occurring character-centric background NPC (for example, your character's long-lost sister, or the devil that sometimes possesses your character), following these guidelines:

- You do not claim named individuals from official materials. (Example: Asmodeus, Ao, Titania, etc.)
- Your PC's existence or connection does not disrupt the setting. (Example: Asmodeus's son being in Silverymoon would be a big deal.)
- You take caution when employing titles and connections to official material. (Examples: A powerful Thayan Wizard is preferable to The Head Wizard of Thay; One Summer Court Fey > Titania's right hand; etc.)

### Extraplanar travel and connections

Writing for extraplanar travel and other extraplanar connections is permitted in some limited cases, following these guidelines:

- Extraplanar travel is a powerful ability, and any character that has this skill knows it is a power not to be treated lightly, and would not make routine use of it.
- Its use should be thoroughly planned and kept in a concise roleplay scenario, and should not involve travel to or from populated areas like cities. The Mythal in Silverymoon expressly forbids transplanar travel, and other cities can be assumed to have equally powerful boundaries or reactive policies in place to prevent abuse of such dangerous magic.
- The use of transplanar travel in games is subject to DM discretion, but players are encouraged to use caution and moderation to avoid disrupting the setting.

## Rule 2: Avoid powergaming & metagaming

📚 **Metagaming** ('Meta'ing) refers to having an in-game character act on knowledge that the player has access to, but the character should not.
- *Example:* Tricking Medusa to stare at a mirror when the character has never heard of Medusa and would not be aware of her petrifying stare. It ruins the fun for other players, and the planning of the DM.

🔥 **Powergaming** involves sometimes extreme min-maxing of character stats, abilities, or situations on a regular basis to prioritize advantages in combat and games to the detriment of storytelling decisions that would have been more consistent with a character or the environment. Since the basis of D&D on our server is to have fun together, there is no winning, and this will only serve to exasperate DMs and other players.
- *Example:* Exploiting the fall damage from your druid summoning a cow 50 feet in the air, as an anticipated regular method of producing damage instead of using a weapon/attack spell. (Hilarious once, not all the time.)

## Rule 3: Respect consent and autonomy

Each person on the server has player and character autonomy. We encourage communication and teamwork first and foremost, but we do not control the decisions of others. Skill check/information cannot be forced from/on the other person if they have not voluntarily consented to it.

Natural character conflict is permitted and encouraged with OOC communication, but characters are not permitted to stalk, harass, or grief other characters.

Before any aspect of an interaction causes a permanent effect or repercussions for a character or their story, such as scarring, destruction of personal belongings, potential repercussions with a patron, etc., communicate with your RP partners before seeing it through. If the consequences are uncertain for the moment, ensure you both consent to leaving it open to development, or refrain from seeing that action through in the first place.

😬 **Example:** A paladin attempting to force others to do good, or, fixating on killing all drow - and verbally harassing another character, without consent.

🚫 **Example:** A player rolling a nat 20 on insight or using telepathy cannot force the other player to provide info.

If issues arise that drastically affect other players in roleplay or a game, notify Mods or the DM to resolve the issue. Please utilize staff for mediation.

## Rule 4: Keep content SFW

Our server is 18+, but not rated R; violence may be descriptive but not gratuitous, adult themes may be explored but not exploited, and sex can be alluded to but not explicit.

When writing / roleplaying, Safe For Work (SFW) is the standard. Violence, sexual implications or acknowledgement (fade to black), non-sexual nudity, minor / recreational drug use, and strong language are permitted. Darker themes, more associated with the horror genre, are still able to be explored on server, so long as triggering content is appropriately warned for consumers!

Explicit RP (descriptions of a sexual scene), sexual assault scenes in any degree of detail, gore, and gratuitous violence (including hardcore non-recreational drug use) are not permitted. Even out of character, and even when joking, these topics are taken seriously and you will be asked to remove the content containing such.

## Rule 5: No Lethal PVP

⚔️ There is no lethal PVP allowed on the server.

Non-lethal PVP is allowed in RP channels without rolls. PVP, simulated practice combat and sparring is allowed in the [🏟️grabiakx-arena](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866398931669909504) with attack rolls and communication in the [🏟️grabiakx-arena-ooc](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/879825883086368850) channel.

Communication about any interaction involving verbal, emotional or physical interpersonal conflict is heavily suggested.

Non-canonical combat of any kind can happen in the Dream Arena. See the Dream Arena guidelines for more details.

## Communication is valued above all!

Whether it's needing time away from the server or pausing time to tuck your kids into bed during a game, player communication is needed for everything to run smoothly. Any communication with us allows for flexibility and understanding, so we value this greatly.

Sound agreeable? Fantastic! Glance over [The Setting](the-setting.html) to see if it's where you want your character to play!
