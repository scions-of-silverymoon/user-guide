# House Rules


This page collects house rulings that clarify or modify RAW (rules as written) for consistent play on Silverymoon.

## Class Specific

### Druids

**Metal Armor**

The default position is that druids don't wear metals, by tradition and druidic CONDUCT (but you're free to justify that as religious/esoteric/physiological reasons).
- Armor and weapons can be not-metal, except plate/half-plate/chain. Leather and scale are usually not-metal enough and get some leeway, and may justifiably be not-metal at all or not-metal enough. 
- You can break the form and be a metal-wearing druid if you also do not claim to come from a tradition or druidic upbringing, and handle druid as a class your character has because it is the closest you can fit your character in. 
- You can also break the form and be a metal-wearing druid if, despite being raised a druid and/or being from a druidic upbringing/organisation, you've fallen out. You should have a strong falling-out plot to justify this and why you'd have all the traditions, yet reject this one particularly.

**Wildshape**

Druids who wish to select dinosaur forms for their Wild Shape feature must meet one of the following in-character prerequisites:

- The character has explicitly travelled to Chult (in their character history or in-play) and therefore has reason to know dinosaur forms exist in the setting; OR
- The character has personally seen that dinosaur in play on the Silverymoon server, and can point to the scene.

### Paladins

**Multiclassing**

In the rules as written, a Paladin must have a Strength of 13 to multiclass, whereas Fighters can have a Strength OR Dexterity of 13. This doesn't seem fair.

On this server, Paladin's multiclassing requirements can be assumed to be:
- Str or Dex 13
- Cha 13

### Wizards

**Shared Spellbooks**

You can copy spells from another wizard's spellbook - but you do need to acknowledge this and come to an agreement in character, in an RP scene, on a quest, or similar.
- You don't need to go through every individual spell in character, but there does need to be explicit agreement
- Thereafter you can copy the spells that were in that other wizards spellbook _at that point in time_. If they later learn new spells, you will need another acknowledgement to access them.
- You still need to use `!dt spell` as usual, you just don't need a scroll to work from.
- When you log the spell learned with `!dt spell last`, make a note as to whose book you learned it from.
