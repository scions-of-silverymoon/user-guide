# Scions of Silverymoon

## A Play-by-Post D&D & Roleplay Community
### A place to play and explore characters by writing!

## 🔸 A Small, Active & Roleplay Focused Community 🔸

Silverymoon aims to be an active, immersive roleplay community using play-by-post methods to run and play D&D. We delve into our character stories together through roleplaying in a variety of channels set throughout the extended area of Silverymoon in Faerun. Games and story building choices are guided by Rules As Written (RAW). See [The Setting](the-setting.html) for more details on setting.

We value those that come in, roleplay, and chat with us, and make our games an even friendlier experience, and are hoping to grow our community with people who feel the same ❤️ Share your characters, art, conversation, and let's play some D&D together!

**Note:** This is run and enjoyed by regular humans who like each other's company and love D&D. Not everything is perfect, patience is required as we do have outside lives, but we try our best to be a supportive, fun environment for those that find a home here.

### Timezones and Game Scheduling

Timezones are primarily mainland, Americas-based, and live games as well as NPC/Staff interaction will likely reflect such, though we try to be flexible when possible. Everyone is welcome, however!

Games are posted variably, based on availability of DMs.

We have both:
- **Traditional play by post**, which continues until complete (no start and end times)
- **'Live' play by post games**, involving posting within specific session time between start and end (i.e. 5-10pm)

Voicechat not required, and will be listed when utilized/offered.

### Activity Requirements

To maintain a quality, active server environment, we ask for a show of interest and maintained activity, so we can see that you're interested in getting involved in the community. See [The Setting](the-setting.html) for outline of activity guidelines.

However, we love and respect that people are busy with life! If something comes up, please chat with staff in PMs or in the [💬staff-help](https://discord.com/channels/866376531995918346/866400097869545492) channel if you cannot meet the requirements for any reason. ❤️

## 🔺 Character Allowances 🔺

- **Dicecloud v2** mostly (v1 and DDB are accepted, but not supported - if you need help with it or does not have access to all of content, we cannot help you much)
- Start at **level 4**
- **XP based leveling**, and **fixed HP**
- **Point Buy**
- Start with free **400gp and starting equipment** (no background gold)
- **Nearly all official WotC content accepted**
- UA and Spelljammer are some of the content not accepted. We go at length at our [character creation guide](character.html) extensively about what is allowed and what is not.
- **Legacy and MotM race versions** both accepted
- **Second character optional** after reaching level 6!

**Excluded:** Races, backgrounds and feats with extra spells or too setting specific, and gunslingers/guns. Subject to change as we grow and learn what works best in our community.

## Server Overview

- Faerun-centered, Forgotten Realms setting (note: not extremely strict to Lore-timeline to allow some flex)
- Downtime activities every week for gold/xp
- XP rewards for active roleplaying
- XP rewards for DMs and Staff
- Generally follow RAW rulings
- (No crafting mechanic, sorry.)

## 🔹 Aim to be Respectful & Drama-Free 🔹

We do not tolerate OOC drama. Staff will contact any players causing strife and handle with communication involving a warning, deliberation between staff, and if necessary, removal from server. Although no community is without some disagreement, we're striving to be an open, understanding and respectful place for everyone.
